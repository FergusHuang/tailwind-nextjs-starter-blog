## Introduction

Firebase Studio can be simply described as a cloud-based VSCode. By using different template entry points, it saves a lot of trouble in setting up a development environment. This article takes building an independent blog as an example to demonstrate how to use Firebase Studio for web development.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## Select the Appropriate Blog Template

I selected [Tailwind Blog](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog) as the basis according to the following criteria.

- Easy for beginners
- Using Next.js as the framework
- Supporting Markdown content
- Not considering complex CMS

Everyone can choose a suitable template from the [blog templates](https://vercel.com/templates?framework=next.js&type=blog) according to your own criteria.

To facilitate code modification and management, I first forked a copy of the [Tailwind GitHub repository](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) to my own account.

## Create a Firebase Workspace

Open [Firebase Studio](https://idx.google.com/)

[![cover](/static/images/building-website/idx-cover.png)](/static/images/building-website/idx-cover.png)
From "Import Repo" enter the URL of the previously forked repository and the name of the workspace.
![import](/static/images/building-website/idx-import.png)
Then, Firebase Studio enters the preparation phase; after waiting for a while, you can officially access the workspace.
![prepare](/static/images/building-website/idx-prepare.png)
Once you have successfully entered, you can directly select and open it from the Firebase Studio homepage thereafter.
![open](/static/images/building-website/idx-open.png)

## Configure

After entering the workspace, a notification will automatically appear in the bottom right corner; this is a necessary configuration for web preview in Firebase Studio.
![configuration](/static/images/building-website/idx-configuration.png)

After clicking the Yes button, system will automatically generate the dev.nix configuration file.

```nix:.idx/dev.nix
{pkgs}: {
  channel = "stable-24.05";
  packages = [
    pkgs.nodejs_20
  ];
  idx.extensions = [

  ];
  idx.previews = {
    enable = true;
    previews = {
      web = {
        command = [
          "npm"
          "run"
          "dev"
          "--"
          "--port"
          "$PORT"
          "--hostname"
          "0.0.0.0"
        ];
        manager = "web";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Then sytem will rebuild the development environment.
![rebuild](/static/images/building-website/idx-rebuild.png)

Once the rebuild is complete, entering the workspace you will be allowed to edit and preview normally.
![enter](/static/images/building-website/idx-enter.png)

## Personalize Your Blog Profile

You can customize your blog profile by modifying the following files.

- data/siteMetadata.js: You can change the title，author， headerTitle， description， email, youtube and more。
- data/authors/default.mdx：You can update the personal photo and bio on the About page。
- data/projectsData.ts：customize the projects you want to showcase.
- data/headerNavLinks.ts：customize navigation links.
- data/blog/\*：In this directory, you can add or modify blog posts in Markdown format (with the .mdx extension).
- public/static/favicons/\*: In this directory, you can add or modify favicons.

## Deploy

Tailwind project supports many deployment methods such as Github pages, Vercel, Netlify and docker. Here, we will only cover the easiest deployment method via Vercel.

Open [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)。
![project](/static/images/building-website/vercel-project.png)

Select your Tailwind github project and import it.
![github](/static/images/building-website/vercel-github.png)
![import](/static/images/building-website/vercel-import.png)

Start the deployment process.
![deploy](/static/images/building-website/vercel-deploy.png)

The deployment will take some time. You can monitor the progress through the build logs. And if there are any errors, you can fix them based on the error messages.
![procedure](/static/images/building-website/vercel-procedure.png)

Once successful, a congratulation window will appear.
![congratulations](/static/images/building-website/vercel-congratulations.png)

Finally, you can access the website through the free domain provided by Vercel.

## Conclusion

Although Firebase Studio is currently still in preview, this cloud-based editing environment is generally usable. Its advantages are clear: no need to set up environments, convenient for cross-device use.
During the process, some issues were also found(not entirely Firebase's fault, but also related to the Tailwind project):

- If unused for a long time, Firebase Studio disconnects, requiring you to return to the homepage and re-enter the project, causing a delay of several tens of seconds.
- Web preview and repsonse are slower than local deployment. Sometimes it doesn't refresh at all and requires a hard restart.
- Replacing images already in use does not update in the web preview.
- The siteLogo configuration in data/siteMetadata.js doesn't take effect. Only replacing data/logo.svg works.
