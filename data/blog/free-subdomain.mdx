## Introduction

To add a free subdomain for your Vercel project, you have two main approaches depending on whether you want a completely free subdomain without owning a domain or want to add a subdomain under a domain you control.

## Using Vercel’s Default Free Subdomain

When you deploy a project on Vercel, it automatically provides a free Vercel subdomain in the format:

```text
your-project-name-random characters.vercel.app
```

This is instantly available with no configuration needed and is free forever. However, it is not customizable beyond your project name.

## Using a Free Community Subdomain

A popular free option for developers is to get a free subdomain under a community-driven domain such as [is-a.dev](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register). This allows you to have a professional-looking subdomain like yourname.is-a.dev linked to your Vercel app at no cost.

Steps to add yourname.is-a.dev to your Vercel project:

- Add the subdomain to your Vercel project in the Domains section to get the CNAME and the TXT verification records.
- Commit and push your JSON files with CNAME and TXT records to the is-a.dev repo to claim your subdomain.

Once merged, the DNS records are updated, and your subdomain becomes live.

## Adding a Subdomain under Your Own Domain

If you own a domain, you can add a subdomain for free by configuring DNS records.

Steps to add a subdomain to your Vercel project:

- Add the subdomain to your Vercel project in the Domains section to get the CNAME and the TXT verification records.
- Log in to your domain registrar’s DNS management panel.
- Configure subdomain with a CNAME record.

| Type  | Name      | Value                 |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------- |
| CNAME | subdomain | cname.vercel-dns.com. |

- Configure a TXT record if the domain is in use by another Vercel account.

| Type | Name     | Value                                           |
| ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| TXT  | \_vercel | vc-domain-verify=subdomain,322661513ac38c634d0b |

| Method                          | Requirements               | Notes                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| default Vercel subdomain        | None                       | Instant, but fixed format           |
| is-a.dev                        | GitHub account, Git skills | Community-driven                    |
| subdomain under your own domain | DNS access                 | Requires domain ownership, flexible |
